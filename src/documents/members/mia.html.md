Mia Lipner has almost 15 years experience working in various aspects of accessibility. She has worked in testing, training of both end-users and developers, compliance and policy, in environments including the private sector and state and Federal government. She believes that the best accessible experiences are ones that are considered early and often during planning, design and development of systems and products, which produce user experiences that are intuitive and supportive to users who rely on accessibility and may also benefit the average user who didnâ€™t think accessibility applied to them. 

In her spare time she enjoys learning new things, whether through reading, travel, geeking out in general, or  or experiences like SCUBA diving.
