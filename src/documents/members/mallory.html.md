Front-end web developer. The keyboard is still the most used device in the
world, though touch screens are caching up fast. So why do most web developers
assumes everyone uses a mouse? More importantly, why is the mouse the *only*
input device considered on major sites? Remember, your phone &#8217;s touch
screen doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hover&#8221; state.

I make sure even the stupid things I&#8217;m forced to code at least work with
keyboard and Make Sense&#8482;
