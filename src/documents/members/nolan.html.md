Nolan began developing software on various Apple computers in the late 80s. He has since written software for OS X and Linux in many languages and on a variety of runtimes. Known best for his creation of the [Spiel](http://spielproject.info) screen reader, he also hacks on [Hermes](http://hermesnav.info), an accessible GPS system. Recent interests tend toward HTML 5 and its use as a cross-platform, accessible application framework.
