Austin is a computer science undergraduate at Florida Atlantic University.  His first notable project outside of the academic environment was
[Camlorn_audio](http://camlorn.net/pages/camlorn_audio.html), a library for 3D audio and environmental audio via [OpenAL Soft](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html).
Shortly after the inception of this project, a fellow developer, Bryan Smart, created an NVDA add-on called Unspoken which uses it.  Austin is now the maintainer of this add-on, and it can be found [here.](http://camlorn.net/pages/unspoken.html)
he also has several other projects in the works, including a more capable library for 3D and environmental audio called [Libaudioverse](http://github.com/camlorn/libaudioverse) and maintains a [blog.](http://camlorn.net/)
