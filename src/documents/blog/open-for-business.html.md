St. Petersburg, FL (May 15 2014) – 3 Mouse Technology (www.3MouseTech.com), a new and very different accessibility consulting company, announced today that it is open for business.   

“3 Mouse Technology (3MT) will be offering services to businesses, organizations and government agencies now required to develop, acquire, maintain and use technology products accessible to people with disabilities.  3MT’s services will be available to any organization who is interested in making their websites, documents or software accessible and compliant with Section 508 and the new Section 508 Refresh, the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and the new ADA Restoration Act, the generally accepted Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), the BBC Mobile Technology Accessibility Checklist and the 21st Century Video and Communication Act of 2010 (CVAA),” says [Mike Calvo](http://3mousetech.com/members/mike), a founding member of 3 Mouse Technology.

“Mike and I wanted to do something different,” says [Chris Hofstader](http://3mousetech.com/members/cdh), managing member of 3MT. “We knew a lot of really smart, independent and productive blind software engineers, guys who’ve made some really impressive technology over the years and, given the enormous and growing demand for qualified accessibility specialists, we decided to build a new company around technology experts from within the community of AT users.”

“Prior to forming 3MT, our membership had separately participated in the development of  five different screen readers (the primary access technology used by people with profound to total vision impairment). We have worked on two screen magnifiers, have written numerous accessible applications on all popular operating systems and have done pretty much everything else involved in making accessible technology,” adds [Christopher Toth](http://3mousetech.com/members/q), another 3MT founder and leader of [GetAccessibleApps](http://www.getaccessibleapps.com).

“At 3 Mouse Technology, three quarters of our members are either blind or low vision. We bring the engineering skills, the knowledge of standards, guidelines and best practices and an intimate knowledge of the usability of a system to our clients,” continues Chris Hofstader.

Those interested in learning more about 3 Mouse Technology, our membership, services and availability can either visit our web site (www.3MouseTech.com) or contact us via our sales email address: sales@3MouseTech.com.
