#Welcome to 3 Mouse Technology

3 Mouse Technology (3MT) is a new company owned and operated by access technology experts who share the goals of achieving universal accessibility through universal design, cooperative corporate governance  and a belief that nothing should be done on the behalf of people with print disabilities without including people with such in every step of the process of achieving full accessibility. 

We’ve been asked, “Where can we find blind software engineers?” and, now, with 3MT, we answer, “right here.”

##Who is 3MT?

Our charter members include people who have worked on five different screen readers as well as having developed fully accessible software on virtually every operating system out there today.

“We’re here! We engineer!” 

##3MT Services

As we are all accessibility experts, we sell contract services to help others design and develop accessible software and hardware. We have skills in all areas related to accessibility ranging from web standards compliance to application and even access technology development. 

##Products We’ve Delivered

Along with many more software and hardware products, the founding members of 3MT have either worked as engineers on or contributed to the creation of the following products. All of these are fully accessible or are, in fact, accessibility user agents themselves.

* JAWS, the most popular screen reader in history.
* SystemAccess, a screen reader popular among novice computer users.
* Spiel, a screen reader alternate to TalkBack on the Android platform.
* Q Read, an accessible book reading program on Windows.
