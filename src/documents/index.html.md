#Welcome to 3 Mouse Technology

We're 3 Mouse Technology (3MT), a new company owned and operated by access technology experts. Our goals are universal accessibility through universal design, cooperative governance, and full inclusion of people with print disabilities in every step toward full accessibility.

People ask us, "Where can we find blind software engineers?". Now, with 3MT, we answer, "right here."

##Who are we?

Our charter members include people who have worked on five different screen readers as well as having developed fully accessible software on virtually every operating system out there today.

*We're here! We engineer!*

##Our services

As we are all accessibility experts, we sell contract services to help others design and develop accessible software and hardware. We have skills in all areas related to accessibility ranging from web standards compliance to application and even access technology development.
